  abstract = {Current installation costs of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are high and profit margins in the offshore wind energy sector are low, it is thus necessary to develop installation methods that are more efficient and practical. This paper presents a numerical study (based on a global response analysis of marine operations) of a novel procedure for installing the tower and Rotor Nacelle Assemblies (RNAs) on bottom-fixed foundations of OWTs. The installation procedure is based on the inverted pendulum principle. A cargo barge is used to transport the OWT assembly in a horizontal position to the site, and a medium-size Heavy Lift Vessel (HLV) is then employed to lift and up-end the OWT assembly using a special upending frame. The main advantage of this novel procedure is that the need for a huge HLV (in terms of lifting height and capacity) is eliminated. This novel method requires that the cargo barge is in the leeward side of the HLV (which can be positioned with the best heading) during the entire installation. This is to benefit from shielding effects of the HLV on the motions of the cargo barge, so the foundations need to be installed with a specific heading based on wave direction statistics of the site and a typical installation season. Following a systematic approach based on numerical simulations of actual operations, potential critical installation activities, corresponding critical events, and limiting (response) parameters are identified. In addition, operational limits for some of the limiting parameters are established in terms of allowable limits of sea states. Following a preliminary assessment of these operational limits, the duration of the entire operation, the equipment used, and weather-and water depth-sensitivity, this novel procedure is demonstrated to be viable.},

Dampers are installed at the bottom to act on the curvature of the tower, and it is shown that dampers installed in suitable braces have the potential to increase the critical damping ratio of the two lowest tower modes by 1 percent. By using a toggle-brace system, damper stroke is increased, while the damper force is reduced. Finally, by installing the dampers in a symmetric configuration, tuning for maximum damping is approximately independent of the orientation of the rotor, thereby making this installation of dampers feasible.

Wind energy is one of the renewable energy resources. Considerable wind speed has made settling of wind turbines at sea beneficial and appealing. For this purpose, choosing the appropriate plates to set up wind turbines on the surface of sea is necessary. Regarding the installation condition, by choosing suitable geometry for floating breakwaters, offshore wind turbine can be mounted on them. Suitable geometry of breakwater for multifunctional usage could be selected with analyzing and comparing pressure, force and moment produced by incoming waves. In this article, the boundary element method is implemented to solve governing differential equations by assuming potential flow. On the other hand, for promoting free surface in each time step, the EulerLagrangian method is employed. Finally, to find the appropriate geometry for installing the wind turbine on the breakwater, moment and wave profile next to the right and left side of breakwater body are calculated. Among simulated geometries, breakwater with trapezoid geometry which its larger base is placed in the water has more sustainability and it is the most suitable geometry for wind turbine installation.},

  abstract = {The crossflow principle is one of the key elements used in engineering models for prediction of the aerodynamic loads on wind turbine blades in standstill or blade installation situations, where the flow direction relative to the wind turbine blade has a component in the direction of the blade span direction. In the present work, the performance of the crossflow principle is assessed on the DTU 10MW reference blade using extensive 3D CFD calculations. Analysis of the computational results shows that there is only a relatively narrow region in which the crossflow principle describes the aerodynamic loading well. In some conditions the deviation of the predicted loadings can be quite significant, having a large influence on for instance the integral aerodynamic moments around the blade centre of mass; which is very important for single blade installation applications. The main features of these deviations, however, have a systematic behaviour on all force components, which in this paper is employed to formulate the first version of an engineering correction method to the crossflow principle applicable for wind turbine blades. The new correction model improves the agreement with CFD results for the key aerodynamic loads in crossflow situations. The general validity of this model for other blade shapes should be investigated in subsequent works.},

The installation cost of a wind farm could be significantly reduced by increasing the wind speed at which blade mounting operations can be carried out. This work characterizes the first-order aerodynamic and aeroelastic behavior of a single blade installation system, where the blade is grabbed by a yoke, which is lifted by the crane and stabilized by two taglines. A simple engineering model is formulated to describe the aerodynamic forcing on the blade subject to turbulent wind of arbitrary direction. The model is coupled with a schematic aeroelastic representation of the taglines system, which returns the minimum line tension required to compensate for the aerodynamic forcing. The simplified models are in excellent agreement with the aeroelastic code HAWC2, and provide a solid basis for future design of an upgraded single blade installation system able to operate at higher wind speeds.},

  abstract = {The offshore wind industry is building and planning new wind farms further offshore due to increasing demand on sustainable energy production and already occupied prime resource locations closer to shore. Costs of operation and maintenance, transport and installation of offshore wind turbines already contribute significantly to the cost of produced electricity and will continue to increase, due to moving further offshore, if the current techniques of predicting offshore wind farm accessibility are to stay the same. The majority of offshore operations are carried out by specialized ships that must be hired for the duration of the operation. Therefore, offshore wind farm accessibility and costs of offshore activities are primarily driven by the expected number of operational hours offshore and waiting times for weather windows, suitable for offshore operations. Having more reliable weather window estimates would result in better wind farm accessibility predictions and, as a consequence, potentially reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. This paper presents an updated methodology of weather window prediction that uses physical offshore vessel and equipment responses to establish the expected probabilities of operation failure, which, in turn, can be compared to maximum allowable probability of failure to obtain weather windows suitable for operation. Two case studies were performed to evaluate the feasibility of the improved methodology, and the results indicated that it produced consistent and improved results. In fact, the updated methodology predicts 57\% and 47\% more operational hours during the test period when compared to standard alpha-factor and the original methodologies.},

These operations are mostly carried out by specific ships that have to be hired for the operational phase and for duration of installation process, respectively. Duration, and therefore ship hiring costs is, among others, driven by waiting time for weather windows for weather-sensitive operations. Today, state of the art decision making criteria for weather-sensitive operations are restrictions to the significant wave height and the average wind velocity at reference height. However, actual limitations are physical, related to response of equipment used e.g. crane wire tension, rotor assembly motions while lifting, etc. Transition from weather condition limits to limits on physical equipment response in decision making would improve weather window predictions, potentially reducing cost of offshore wind energy.

The present paper utilizes a three-dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) to mitigate the bidirectional vibrations as well as harvest the kinetic energy using a linear electromagnetic energy harvester. The proposed energy harvester consists of magnets and coil assemblies which are connected with the pendulum to convert the kinetic energy of the pendulum into electricity. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established using Euler-Lagrangian equation. The mathematical model of the linear electromagnetic energy harvester is established and integrated with the wind turbine model. The optimum design of the electromagnetic energy harvester to minimize the nacelle displacement RMS as well as to maximize the energy output is determined via a numerical search method. The NREL 5 MW baseline wind turbine model is utilized to evaluate the performance of the 3d-PTMD and the energy harvester. Results show that the 3d-PTMD can reduce the bi-directional vibrations induced by misaligned wind and wave loadings. Additionally, electrical energy in orders of magnitude of kilowatts can be harnessed via using the energy harvester.},

For single-blade installations on offshore monopile-type wind turbines, a jack-up vessel is often involved, and each blade is mated with the hub at the tower top. Prior to the alignment phase, the blade root and the nacelle at the tower top experience relative motions. The blade-root motions are induced by the wind loads, and the nacelle motions are due to the resonant vibrations of the monopile support structure under wave loading. To alleviate the relative motions and to facilitate the alignment process, external passive tuned mass dampers can be installed on the monopile support structures. This work investigates the application potential of tuned mass dampers in single-blade installation. Multibody simulations were conducted under collinear wind and waves conditions, and the relative motions between the blade-root and the hub were analysed. It was found that when an optimally tuned passive damper is considered for the monopile structure, the reduction in the critical motion radius can reach up to 30\%.},

If a jack-up vessel is used during an o shore installation, the wind turbine blade is mainly subjected to wind loads and experiences resonant motions, and the monopile is subjected to wave-induced vibrations. The blade mating process can be challenging if large relative motions occur between the blade root and the monopile top. This study numerically models a blade installation system that consists of a pre-installed monopile and nacelle assembly, and a 5 MW blade with tugger lines. By analyzing the blade-root and the hub motion radii from time-domain simulations, we evaluate the effects of mean wind speed, wind turbulence, significant wave height, wave spectrum peak period, wind-wave misalignment, and water depth on the blade installation. For the alignment phase, the blade-root motion is critical, especially when the mean wind speed and turbulence are high. The hub motion can be important when the monopile resonant responses are prominent. The relative in-plane motions rather than the hub or the blade motion alone should be considered during the assessment. For the mating phase, the high-frequency components of the responses are important in general. Because of the dominant flange-hole motions at the monopile top, an increase in water depth reduces the success rate of mating.},

  abstract = {With single elements weighing up to hundreds of tonnes and lifted to heights of 100 meters, off shore wind turbines can pose risks to personnel, assets, and the environment during installation and maintenance interventions. To increase safety during off shore lifts, this study focuses on solutions for human-free lifting operations. Ideas in the categories of logistics, connections, as well as guidance and control, were discussed and ranked by means of a multi-criteria decision analysis. Based upon 38 survey responses weighting 21 predefined decision criteria, the most promising concepts were selected. Logistically, pre-assembled systems would reduce the number of lifts and thus reduce the risk. A MATLAB-based code has been developed to optimise installation time, lifted weight, and number of lifts. Automated bolting and seafastening solutions have high potential to increase safety during the transport of the wind turbine elements and, additionally, speed up the process. Finally, the wind turbine should be lifted on top of the support structure without having personnel being under the load. A multidirectional mechanical guiding element has been designed and tested successfully in combination with visual guidance by cameras in a small-scale experiment.},

  abstract = {During the commissioning and stand-still cycles of wind turbines, the rotor is often stopped or even locked leaving the rotor blades at a standstill. When the blades are at a standstill, angles of attack on the blades can be very high, and it is therefore possible that they experience vortex-induced vibrations. This experiment and analysis helps to explain the different regimes of flow at very high angles of attack, particularly on moderately twisted and tapered blades. A single blade was tested at two different flow velocities at a range of angles of attack with flow tuft visualization and hotwire measurements of the wake. Hotwire wake measurements were able to show the gradual inception and ending of certain flow regimes. The power spectral densities of these measurements were normalized in terms of Strouhal number based on the projected chord to show that certain wake features have a relatively constant Strouhal number. The shedding frequency appears then to be relatively independent of chord taper and twist. Vortex generators (VGs) were tested but were found to have little influence in this case. Gurney flaps were found to modify the wake geometry, stall onset angles, and in some cases the shedding frequency.},

  abstract = {This study addresses numerical simulations of the lifting operation of a monopile for an offshore wind turbine with a focus on the lowering process. A numerical model of the coupled system of the monopile and vessel is established. The disturbed wave field near the vessel is investigated and observed to be affected by the diffraction and radiation of the vessel. The shielding effects of the vessel during the continuous lowering operation are accounted for in this study by developing an external Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that interacts with SIMO program in the time-domain simulations. The DLL is implemented by interpolating fluid kinematics between pre-defined wave points near the vessel. Based on the time-domain simulations, the critical responses, such as the motions of the monopile, the tensions in the lift wire and the contact forces in the gripper device in the disturbed wave fields, are compared with those in incident wave conditions. The results indicate that a great reduction in these extreme responses can be achieved when the shielding effects are considered. The sensitivity study of the responses in different wave directions is performed. The results indicate different behaviours with different wave directions and with short or long waves. A comparison of the responses when using a floating vessel and a jack-up vessel is also studied and can be used to support the choice of installation vessel type. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to present a method for assessing the allowable sea states for the initial hammering process (shallow penetrations in the seabed) of a monopile (MP) using a heavy lift floating vessel (HLV) for use in the planning of the operation. This method combines the commonly used installation procedure and the time-domain simulations of the sequential installation activities. The purpose of the time-domain simulation is to quantitatively study the system dynamic responses to identify critical events that may jeopardize the installation and the corresponding limiting response parameters. Based on the allowable limits and the characteristic values of the limiting response parameters, a methodology to find the allowable sea states is proposed. Case studies are presented to show the application of the methodology. The numerical model of the dynamic HLV\textendash MP system includes the coupling between HLV and MP via a gripper device, and soil\textendash MP interaction at different MP penetration depths. It is found that the limiting parameters are the gripper force and the inclination of the MP. The systematic approach proposed herein is general and applies to other marine operations.},

However, with their increasing distance from the shore, greater water depths, and increasing sizes of the plants, the industry has to face the challenge to develop sustainable installation procedures. Important limiting factors for offshore wind farm installation are the weather conditions and installation strategies. In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of the most effective approach to installing offshore wind farms at sea, including the effects of weather conditions. This target is achieved through the implementation of a discrete-event simulation approach which includes the analysis of the environmental conditions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics, and assembly scenarios. The model maps the logistics chain in the offshore wind industry. A deterministic and a probabilistic metocean data method have been compared and cross validated. The results point to a good agreement between the two considered models, while highlighting the huge risks to the time and cost of the installation due to the stochastic nature of the weather. We suggest that simulations may improve and reduce these risks in the planning process of offshore wind farms.},

Such situations can, in practice, occur for onshore and especially offshore wind turbines and are attributed to aging, turbine installation, scour or marine sand dunes phenomena and biofouling. Practical experience of wind turbine manufacturing industry has shown that such effects are most easily quantified in terms of the first natural frequency of the turbine support structure. The paper brings forward a study regarding the amount to which nominal tower damping controller performance is affected by changes in the turbine natural frequency. Subsequently, an adaptive tower damping control loop is designed using linear parameter-varying control synthesis; the proposed tower damping controller depends on this varying parameter which is assumed throughout the study to be readily available. An investigation of the fatigue load reduction performance in comparison with the original tower damping control approach is given for a generic three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine.

This study considers the installation modelling for UK offshore Wind Rounds 1 and 2 using probabilistic simulation tool. The tool is used to output time-domain predictions for the completion of key installation phases. By varying key wind farm characteristics such as distance to shore and the number of turbines, an assessment of vessel performance was completed for each round by reviewing recorded durations predicted by the software. The results provide a quantification of installation vessel performance and the associated deviations present a measure of installation risk. It is identified that the Round 1 vessels experience less weather downtime but higher variability and the Round 2 vessels perform more consistently but experience larger delays.

Rational-exponent Lyapunov functions (ReLFs) are employed in the backstepping design, and the Bernoulli inequality is primarily adopted in the stability proof. Semiglobal practical finite-time stability, or global asymptotically stability, is guaranteed by a continuous control law using a commonly used recursive backstepping-like approach. Unlike the inductive design of typical finite-time backstepping controllers, the proposed method has the advantage of reduced design complexity. The virtual control laws are designed by directly canceling the nonlinear terms in the derivative of the specific Lyapunov functions. The terms with exponents are transformed into linear forms as their bases. The stability proof is simplified by applying several inequalities in the final proof, instead of in each step. Furthermore, the singularity problem no longer exists. The weakness of the concept of practical finite-time stability is discussed. The method can be applied to smoothly extend numerous design methodologies with asymptotic stability with a higher convergence rate near the equilibrium. Two numerical case studies are provided to present the performance of the proposed control.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have become increasingly popular for their ability to harvest clean offshore wind energy. Bottom-fixed foundations are the most used foundation type. Because of its large diameter, the foundation is sensitive to wave loads. For typical manually assisted blade-mating operations, the decision to perform the mating operation is based on the relative distance and velocity between the blade root center and the hub, and in accordance with the weather window. Hence, monitoring the hub real-time position and velocity is necessary, whether the blade installation is conducted manually or automatically. In this study, we design a hub motion estimation algorithm for the OWT with a bottom-fixed foundation using sensor fusion of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Two schemes are proposed based on a moving horizon estimator, a multirate Kalman filter, an online smoother, and a predictor. The moving horizon estimator mitigates the slow GNSS sampling rate relative to the hub dynamics. The multirate Kalman filter estimates the position, velocity, and accelerometer bias with a constant GNSS measurement delay. The online smoothing algorithm filters the delayed estimated trajectory to remove sudden step changes. The predictor compensates the delayed estimate, resulting in real-time monitoring. HAWC2 and MATLAB are used to verify the performance of the estimation algorithms, showing that a sufficiently accurate real-time position and velocity estimate with a high sampling rate is achieved. A sensitivity study compares the accuracy of different algorithms applied in various conditions. By combining both proposed algorithms, a sufficiently accurate estimation can be achieved for a wider scope of practical applications.},

Guidelines and standards for health and safety in lifting operations exist; however, having people directly beneath the load is still common practice in offshore wind turbine installations. Concepts for human-free offshore lifting operations in the categories of guidance and control, connections, and assembly are studied in this work. This paper documents the process of applying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), using experts' opinions for the importance of defined criteria obtained by conducting an industry survey, to benchmark the suitability of the concepts at two stages. Stage one streamlined possible options and stage two ranked the remaining suite of options after further development. The survey results showed that criteria such as 'reduction of risk', 'handling improvement' and 'reliability of operation' were most important. The most viable options, weighted by industry opinion, to remove personnel from areas of high risk are: Boom Lock and tag lines, a camera system with mechanical guidance, and automated bolt installation/fastening for seafastening. The decision analysis framework developed can be applied to similar problems to inform choices subject to multiple criteria.},

  abstract = {One of the major concern of wind farm offshore is the type of wind turbine foundation to be installed. When it comes to talk about offshore installation of pre-piled fixed jacket foundations (3-4 legs), one of the most critical activities to be performed by the installer is the grouting operation. For currently wind turbines size, pre-piling jacket installation is a very extended alternative used which are drilled into the seabed until only 4-5 m come out the seabed line. Once piles have been installed into the seabed it comes the time to proceed with jacket legs installation. Next step is to grouting-secured together both structures (pile and jacket) pouring grout, throughout the already pre-installed grouting lines into the lower part of the jacket leg. Due to complexity of the overall manoeuvre as well as required precision not only for the grout system but for the right parameters should be considered for pouring in order to ensure the grout correctly into the pile/jacket annulus without segregation or other undesirable effects occurring a mockup test was carried out. The proposed and analysed method defines a protocol that could be used and repeated for others offshore windfarms that are planned to be installed in the future over pre-pilled foundations. Running a grout wall test based on protocol described on this paper prior to offshore grout operations will guarantee mix of grout and lub is in line with grouting foundations requirements, saving pumping grout time and therefore vessel stand by costs as well as money savings for grout exceeds, avoiding segregation problems could lead up to in worst case to foundations removal with massive vessel standby costs for reparation of the entire installation foundation operation.},

This contribution presents the results of a monitoring campaign conducted during the installation of an offshore wind park in the North Sea. The campaign covered different states of the turbines: without rotor blades, with rotor blades, without supplementary damping system and with an installed, tuned mass damper system. The objective of the campaign was to determine the dynamic behaviour of the turbines in correlation with wind and wave data and to determine modal parameters. Accordingly, the turbines have been instrumented with sensors to record accelerations at three different positions. The modal parameters were then obtained using SSI/FDD algorithms. Structural damping is additionally determined with an RDM algorithm, and the results are being compared. The analysis of the data will be presented, including the different stages of the structural damping and the corresponding changes in movement patterns. The results shall be used to verify the load models and the predicted response of the structure.},

The method is based on the comparison between the conventional sensor and a distant long range lidar pointing to it in staring mode. By comparing their line-of-sight wind speeds any misalignment between both systems can be estimated more accurately. This method was applied in an measurement campaign in the offshore wind farm alpha ventus next to the meteorological mast FINO1. The maximum alignment error of a Sonic was reduced to below +/- 1 degrees. This accurate alignment has asserted, that no bias exists between Lidar and Sonic wind speed measurements.},

An alternative to the traditional joint is a steel-to-steel connection also called a slip joint. To ensure a proper fit of the slip joint a dynamic installation of the joint is proposed. In this contribution, the effectiveness of harmonic excitation as an installation procedure is experimentally investigated using a 1:10 scaled model of the joint. During the dynamic installation test the applied static load, settlements and dynamic response of the joint are monitored using respectively load cells, taut wires and strain gauges placed both inside and outside the conical surfaces. The results show that settlement occurs only when applying a harmonic load at specific forcing frequencies. The settlement stabilizes to a certain level for each of the specific frequencies, indicating that a controlled way of installation is possible. The results show that it is essential to vibrate at specific frequencies and that a larger amplitude of the harmonic force does not automatically lead to additional settlement.},

In this paper, a three-dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) is attached to the OWT to mitigate the bi-directional vibrations resulting from wind-wave misalignment so as to increase the fatigue life. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3dPTMD is established using the Euler-Lagrangian equation. To predict long-term metocean condition, a statistical analysis for different properties of wind and wave loading such as, windwave misalignment, significant wave height and wind velocity is carried out. The aerodynamic wind loading is calculated using the blade element method and the wave loading is computed using the JONSWAP wave spectrum and Morison equation. Dual linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) deployed in the side-side and fore-aft directions are used for comparison. The NREL monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine is used to examine the performance of 3d-PTMD in a realistic metocean condition. The fatigue damage is estimated based on the rain-flow cycle counting method and Miner's rule. Results indicate that the 3d-PTMD can increase the wind turbine tower fatigue life by more than 50\% in comparison with the dual TMDs.},

However, most of existing research in this field focused on unidirectional vibration mitigation, which is insufficient for research and real application. Based on the authors' work (C. Sun and Jahangiri 2018), the present study uses a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3dPTMD) to mitigate the nacelle structural response in the fore-aft and side-side directions under wind, wave and near-fault ground motions. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established wherein the interaction between the blades and the tower is modelled. Aerodynamic loading is computed using the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) method where the Prandtl's tip loss factor and the Glauert correction are considered. Wave loading is computed using Morison equation in collaboration with the strip theory. Performance of the 3d-PTMD is examined on a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine under misaligned windwave and near-fault ground motions. The robustness of the mitigation performance of the 3d-PTMD under system variations is studied. Dual linear TMDs are used for comparison. Research results show that the 3d-PTMD responds more rapidly and provides better mitigation of the bi-directional response caused by misaligned wind, wave and near-fault ground motions. Under system variations, the 3d-PTMD is found to be more robust than the dual linear TMDs to overcome the detuning effect. Moreover, the 3dPTMD with a mass ratio of 2\% can mitigate the short-term fatigue damage of the offshore wind turbine tower by up to 90\%.},

  abstract = {Single-blade installation is a conventional method for installing blades on monopile-type offshore wind turbines. A jack-up crane vessel is commonly used, and individual blades are lifted to the tower top height and mated with the hub. The relative motions between the hub and blade root during the mating phase, partly due to wind-induced blade motion and partly due to waveinduced monopile motion, can induce substantial impact forces at the blade root. This can cause severe damage at the blade root connections and have a high potential to jeopardise the installation task. Mitigation measures are therefore required to limit the relative motion between the hub and the root during the mating process. In this article, we investigate the effects of a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) on the (1) impact velocities manifested between the blade root and hub during the mating phase and (2) its effect on the response-based limiting sea states. Timedomain multi-body simulations of an installation system characterising the mating operation with and without a TMD for collinear and misaligned wind and wave conditions have been performed, and the effectiveness of TMD for controlling the impact velocity is quantified. Furthermore, finite element analyses are performed to determine the threshold velocity of impact for a scenario in which a blade root with a guide pin suffers a sideways impact with the hub. It is found that the tuned mass damper can reduce the relative impact velocities by more than 40\% and can sub\- stantially expand the allowable sea states and operability for the mating operation. Moreover, the effectiveness of TMD at reducing the impact velocity increases with increasing significant wave height (Hs); however, it decreases with increasing wind-wave misalignment and with shifts in the wave spectral peak period (Tp) away from the tuned frequency. The findings of the study can be utilised for planning safe and cost-efficient installation of latest-generation wind turbine blades.},

  abstract = {Most wind turbine blades are assembled piece-by-piece onto the hub of a monopile-type offshore wind turbine using jack-up crane vessels. Despite the stable foundation of the lifting cranes, the mating process exhibits substantial relative responses amidst blade root and hub. These relative motions are combined effects of wave-induced monopile motions and wind-induced blade root motions, which can cause impact loads at the blade root's guide pin in the course of alignment procedure. Environmental parameters including the wind-wave misalignments play an important role for the safety of the installation tasks and govern the impact scenarios. The present study investigates the effects of wind-wave misalignments on the blade root mating process on a monopile-type offshore wind turbine. The dynamic responses including the impact velocities between root and hub in selected wind-wave misalignment conditions are investigated using multibody simulations. Furthermore, based on a finite element study, different impact-induced failure modes at the blade root for sideways and head-on impact scenarios, developed due to wind-wave misalignment conditions, are investigated. Finally, based on extreme value analyses of critical responses, safe domain for the mating task under different wind-wave misalignments is compared. The results show that although misaligned wind-wave conditions develop substantial relative motions between root and hub, aligned wind-wave conditions induce largest impact velocities and develop critical failure modes at a relatively low threshold velocity of impact.},

  abstract = {The growing requirements of large-sized offshore wind turbines require heavier components to be lifted to large heights using installation vessels. This imposes a substantial risk of impact to the lifted components especially when floating crane vessels are used. Floating crane vessels are in general sensitive to wave-induced motion, causing substantial crane tip responses and can lead to significant damage to the lifted blades. Currently, the planning for such weather sensitive operation does not include explicitly the risk of contact/impact or damage in the components to determine the operational limits. This is important for wind turbine blades owing to the fact that they are made of composite materials and are vulnerable to damage from contact/impact loads. The present paper proposes a novel methodology to determine response based operational limit for the blade installation by considering impact loads. Structural damage criteria for the lifted blade under accidental loads are linked with global response analysis of the installation system under stochastic wind and wave loads. A case study is also presented where a wind turbine blade lifted horizontally using jack-up crane vessel impacts the pre-assembled turbine tower with its tip region while being installed under mean wind speed of 10 m/s. It is found that under such conditions, it is safe to install blade from structural damage perspective as the characteristic responses obtained were low to develop any damage in the blade. The findings of the study can be used to derive limiting sea states for blade installation using floating vessels, however a damage tolerance approach requiring residual strength analysis post impact is compulsory.},

  abstract = {Single-blade installation is a popular method for installing blades on bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines. A jackup crane vessel is often employed, and individual blades with their roots equipped with mechanical joints and bolted connections are lifted to the tower-top height and mated with a pre-assembled hub. The final mating phase is challenging and faces significant risks of impact. Due to relative motions between the blade and the hub, substantial impact forces may arise and lead to severe structural damages at root connections, thereby causing delays in the installation task. The present paper considers a realistic scenario of the mating process and investigates the consequences of such impact loads. Here, a single-blade model with tugger lines and a monopile model were established using a multi-body formulation, and relative velocities under collinear wave and wind conditions were obtained. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed for the blade root with Tbolt connections, and an impact investigation was performed for the case in which a guiding connection impacts the hub. The results show severe bending and plastic deformation of the guide pin bolt together with failure of the adjoining composite laminate at the root connection. Based on the type of damage obtained for the different environmental conditions considered, this paper also discusses its consequence on the installation tasks and suggests onboard decision making in case of an impact incident. The results of this study provide new insights regarding the mating phase and can be utilised to establish response-based operational limits.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind farm installation planning is highly complex, due to the high dependency on weather and the oversized components that impose specific constraints in areas such as transportation and lifting. Currently, there is very little transparency vis-\`a-vis the logistics challenges in the industry. We extend the literature by creating an overall view of the coherency between logistical methods and project performance. We develop knowledge about how to use the various approaches by analyzing different logistical solutions. A holistic view of the coherency between the approaches in terms of logistics and project performance, taking into consideration the external influence of weather, is provided through analysis of actual projects in the North Sea region. Case study findings reveal the major factors to be pre-assembly, vessel load, and the distance to shore. We suggest a pre-assembly strategy comprised of a minimum number of components for installation onsite and a maximum number of turbines to be loaded on a vessel. These findings are especially important for the new wind farms being positioned further offshore. We show by means of a case study, with specific characteristics and weather conditions, that the appropriate strategies can be arrived at by using a simulation-based decision-support tool we developed.},

Abstract Offshore wind farms will have larger capacities in the future than they do today. Thus, the costs that are associated with the installation of wind turbines and the connection of power grids will be much higher, thus the location of wind turbines and the design of internal cable connections will be even more important. A large wind farm comprises of hundreds of wind turbines. Modeling each using a complex model leads to long simulation timesespecially in transient response analyses. Therefore, in the future, simulations of power systems with a high wind power penetration must apply the equivalent wind-farm model to reduce the burden of calculation. This investigation examines significant issues around the optimal design of a modern offshore wind farm layout and its equivalent model. According to a review of the literature, the wake effect and its modeling, layout optimization technologies, cable connection design, and wind farm reliability, are significant issues in offshore wind farm design. This investigation will summarize these important issues and present a list of factors that strongly influence the design of an offshore wind farm.},

As a new technology, the one-step integrated transportation and installation technology of offshore wind power has broader application prospects. In order to ensure stability during the towing process, it is necessary to study the behavior of the wind turbine transportation structure. The numerical model of the specialized transportation vessel was set up by MOSES software. An analysis in the frequency domain and time domain was conducted considering the effects of draft, speed, and wave height on the towing stability of the wind turbine transportation vessel. The results show that the one-step integrated transportation method can ensure stability of the wind turbine during the towing process. Reducing draft, increasing speed, and increasing wave height will reduce the towing stability of the wind turbine. In the practical towing process, the combination of various adverse situations will be avoided.},

A jack-up crane vessel is subjected to wind and wave loads, which cause motion at crane tip. Excessive motion at crane tip can lead to failure of lifting operations. Therefore, the crane tip motion should be properly assessed for jack-up crane vessels. In this study, a fully coupled model is developed for a typical elevated jack-up crane vessel, considering the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads on the vessel, the soil-structure interaction, and the structural flexibility of the jack-up legs and crane. The vessel model developed is further coupled with the SIMO-Aero code to achieve a fully coupled aero-hydro-soil-elastic-mechanical code SIMO-RIFLEX-Aero for numerical modeling and dynamic analysis of offshore single blade installation using jack-up crane vessels. The SIMO-RIFLEX-Aero code is then applied to study the dynamic response of the DTU 10 MW wind turbine blade installed by a typical jack-up crane vessel under various wind and wave conditions. The results show that significant motion is induced at crane tip, mainly due to wave loads. It is important to consider the structural flexibility of the jack-up legs and crane when modeling the installation of offshore wind turbine blades.},

They are thus a promising alternative to install offshore wind turbine components, especially in intermediate and deep water. However, the wave-induced motions of the floating vessels make the operations challenging. This study deals with a preliminary feasibility study on offshore single blade installation using floating crane vessels. Two typical floating crane vessels are considered, i.e., a mono-hull vessel and a semi-submersible vessel. They are assumed to be equipped with dynamic positioning systems that can well mitigate the slowly varying horizontal motions. Their overall performance during the blade installation is numerically evaluated by comparing their performance against a typical jack-up crane vessel. The crane dynamics plays a less important role for blade installation by floating vessels, compared to the jack-up crane vessel. The floating vessels' wave-induced motion greatly affects the blade motion. The semi-submersible vessel causes a much smaller blade motion than the mono-hull vessel. The results indicate that it is feasible to install offshore wind turbine blades by using floating crane vessels provided that the vessel type is properly selected. From the operability point of view, semi-submersible vessels are more feasible than mono-hull vessels for offshore single blade installations.},

Then, numerical modelling and simulations are carried out in the time domain to analyse the coupled dynamic system taking into consideration of the nonlinearities of the system. In time-domain analysis, two lifting phases are brought into focus, i.e., the lift-off and the lowering phases. For the lift-off phase, two scenarios are considered, i.e., lift-off from the own deck of the HLV and lift-off from a transport barge. Moreover, comparative studies using two types of installation vessels, a floating vessel and a Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process. Critical responses including the motions of the tripod and the lift wire tensions are presented and compared under various environmental and loading conditions.},
