-Note: use only epoch, date(time) values might be inconsistent due to timezones etc


Files containing blade landing time stamps:

-The file "blade_landing_sbitroot_helihoist1_helihoist2.xlsx" contains the (final) blade landings 
-The image "blade_landing_overview_sbitroot_helihoist1_helihoist2_combined.png" gives an visual overview of the final blade landings (note: datetime values might be incorrect)


Remarks:

-Not all turbines are included for the analysis, of turbine 17 -32 only turbine [19    22    23    24    25    26    27    28    29    32] are analysed. Rest is ignored due to issues such as overlapping time stamps 
-No SBIT tip sensor data available (at this moment, at least), so only sbit root sensor is used for final analysis
-Both helihoist-1 & helihoist-2 data is used,
-Turbine 22: 4 blade landings??
