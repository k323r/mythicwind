# TOM data description

The abbreviation __TOM__ referes to __Tower Oscillation Measurement__ and the data that was acquired using a specific set of sensor boxes built by university of Bremen for this specific purpose.

These Sensor Boxes were initially designed to measure accelerations and GPS tracks of offshore wind turbine towers undergoing installation. During the installation of the wind farm Trianel Windpark Borkum II they were subsequentially used to track the complete installation with a focus on single blade installation

Data from the TOM devices comes as CSV files. The firmware of the boxes was designed, such that data was written into 10 MB sized txt files instead of one large txt file in order to circumvent data corruption due to power loss. However, this leads to a few milliseconds of missing data between log files. Additionally, jitter due to IO-Operations is present in the data as well and data should under all circumstance be resampled befor further analysis.

Parameters provided by the TOM devices are listed in the following table:

| Parameter       | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| truetime        | human readable, time zone aware time stamp generated by pandas [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+XX:XX] where XX:XX represents the time zone|
| epoch           | machine readable time stamp based on the unix epoch [s] |
| runtime         | time since last boot of the tom device [ms] |
| gpstime         | time string from GNSS sensor in UTC [YYYT-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS] |
| latitude        | Degrees latitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due North] |
| longitude       | Degrees longitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due East] |
| elevation       | elevation above mean sea level [m] |
| rot_{x,y,z}     | Rotational acceleration around the three cartesian axis {x,y,z} of the TOM box. [degree / s^2] |
| acc_{x,y,z}     | linear acceleration in each of the three cartesian axis {x,y,z} in the reference system of the TOM box [m/s^2] |
| mag_{x,y,z}     | magnetic field strength in each of the local cartesian TOM box axis {x,y,z} [micro-Tesla] |
| roll            | eulerian roll angle (angle around the x Axis of the tom box) [degree] |
| pitch            | eulerian pitch angle (angle around the y Axis of the tom box) [degree] |
| yaw            | eulerian yaw angle (angle around the z Axis of the tom box) [degree] |
